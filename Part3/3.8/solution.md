---SOLUTION---
We define a build stage using the AS keyword and name it builder.
We set the working directory to /usr/src/app in both stages.
In the build stage, we copy the package.json and package-lock.json (or yarn.lock) files to the working directory and run npm ci to install dependencies based on the lockfile. This ensures reproducibility and faster installation.
We copy the entire project directory to the build stage.
We run npm run build to build your React application.
Now, we start the runtime stage using the same node:16-alpine base image.
We expose port 5000 to allow external access to your application.
We copy the build directory from the build stage to the working directory in the runtime stage. This contains the compiled static files from the React build.
We install the serve package globally to serve the static files.
We create an appgroup group and an appuser user within that group.
We switch the user to appuser for improved security.
Finally, we set the command to start the serve package, serving the static files in the build directory on port 5000.

#
1-Use a minimal base image: Instead of golang:1.16-alpine, we can use an even smaller base image like golang:1.16-alpine3.13. This reduces the image size further.

2-Leverage multi-stage builds: Multi-stage builds allow us to build the application in one stage and copy only the necessary artifacts to the final stage. This helps reduce the final image size by excluding build dependencies.

3-Use Go modules for dependency management: Go modules provide a better and more controlled way of managing dependencies. We can leverage Go modules to ensure reproducibility and faster builds.

4-Enable CGO and set build flags: By enabling CGO and setting appropriate build flags, we can optimize the binary size and performance.

5-Cleanup unnecessary artifacts: Remove unnecessary files and dependencies after the build stage to minimize the size of the final image.



# Here's a summary of the optimizations made:

1-We switched to the golang:1.16-alpine3.13 base image to use a more minimal version of Alpine Linux.

2-The build stage leverages multi-stage builds, separating the build environment from the final runtime environment.

3-Go modules are used for dependency management.

4-We enable CGO and set the -ldflags="-s -w" build flag to optimize the binary size by stripping debugging symbols and reducing binary metadata.

5-Unnecessary files and dependencies are removed after the build stage, resulting in a smaller final image.
